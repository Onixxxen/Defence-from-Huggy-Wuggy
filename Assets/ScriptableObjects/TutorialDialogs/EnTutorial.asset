  DialogStageOne:
  - Hi. It's me, the brain. Yeah the one you see on your screen. I'm still very small
    and underdeveloped. Well, that's not surprising
  - Pretty soon I'll have the Huggy Wuggy, Kissy Missy and Killy Willy crowds all
    over me
  - I hope you can clean me up and not let me be eaten by those toys
  - Let's start with 50 neurons so you can develop me
  - Just click on me and have fun
  DialogStageTwo:
  - You did it! Thanks to you, we can now be better
  - Click on the lighted button below and in the window that appears, buy one click
    more neuron upgrade
  DialogStageThree:
  - 'HOORAY!!!!! I can feel you and I getting smarter. And the further we get, the
    smarter we get! '
  - Let's now accumulate 100 neurons altogether to improve our defense against Huggy
    Wuggy. How's that for an idea?
  DialogStageFour:
  - 'What an AMAZING you are! Have you developed little brains before? '
  - Now let's do the same thing we did with neurons per click
  - Click the button at the bottom and buy an upgrade for protection so no Huggy
    Wuggy will interfere with our enjoyable time
  DialogStageFive:
  - Did you pull that off, too? Bravo, that's bravo.
  - 'Oh, we have very little time left before the day arrives... '
  - 'Huggy Wuggy is attacking us during the day, because the information flow around
    you and me is most active at this time. '
  - And only you can prevent it. Click fast like Sonic and shop big like the rappers.
  - 'It''s all in your fingers. THE GAME STARTED! '
  DialogStageSix:
  - The fun part begins. I hope you're well prepared and ready to explode Huggy Wuggy
  - 'Your goal is to launch neurons in the direction of Huggy Waggy and BREAK THEM.
    HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

'
  - There are recovery buttons at the bottom by the way so you can patch me up
  - Click as much as possible. Just make sure you don't blow yourself up, or you
    and I will be in trouble.
  DialogStageSeven:
  - 'YEEEEEEEEEAS. YOU DID IT!

    YOU PROTECTED ME! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!! '
  - 'Let''s keep it up, shall we? I believe in you, you will do great! '
  - I hope you can protect me for the maximum number of days, so come on, show me
    what you can do in combat conditions
